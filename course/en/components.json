As the volume of open data being consumed and published increases, so does the importance of this data to the strategic decisions of the organisation. To safeguard the use of data and ensure it delivers value, organisations need a data strategy that sets out clear, consistent protocols for the collection, use and sharing of data.</p>\n\n<p>Developing data strategy can seem like a daunting process. However, with a few simple principles to guide the design and creation, data strategies can be put in place rapidly and immediately begin delivering improvements.</p>\n\n<p>This module will prepare you with the tools to develop, write and implement a data strategy.</p>\n",

This could be everything from sales reports and&nbsp;customer insights to&nbsp;operations to marketing.</p>\n\n<p>The strategy begins by setting out how the organisation believes data should add value to their activities. These beliefs can be very simple (e.g. data will help&nbsp;us sell our products in more markets) or more complex (e.g. data will allow us to continuously monitor the efficiency of our operations and optimise in real time).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Our strategy then sets out a plan of action for achieving the value set out in the statements. This plan is used to inform the decisions managers make about how to work so must be clear, achievable and have an obvious benefit for the organisation.</p>\n\n<p>Data strategies vary dramatically in length according to the complexity of data within the organisation.

    "body": "<p>Strategy is only as effective as the ability of staff to execute it. If your organisation does not understand the importance of data strategy or the direct impact on their work, they are less likely to support your initiatives and more likely to steer the organisation into the resistant or piecemeal state.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Putting in place the skills to execute data strategy begins with a profile of your workforce, their activities and current proficiencies. To help you address this for the unique challenges of open data, the ODI has created the Data Skills Framework. The Framework is a set of core skills that are important to executing data strategy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Framework works at three levels. The top level groups your workforce into their current level of proficiency, either Explorer (newcomer), Strategist &amp; Practitioner (experienced manager or specialist respectively) or Pioneer (your leading experts).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxZjxjoFCNfSRFV1TTlwU3p3WG8/view?usp=sharing\">To learn how to use the framework in your own data strategy, follow this exercise</a>.</p>\n",
